
In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I then identified the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimized this algorithm to best model the data.

The goal of this analysis is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 USD annually. This sort of task is common in a non-profit settings, where organizations survive on donations.

Armed with information on an individual's income level aids non-profits in understanding how large of a donation to request, or whether they should contact certain individuals begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publicly available features such as government census studies.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.
